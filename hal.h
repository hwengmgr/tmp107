/* This example assumes a hardware UART with dedicated Tx and Rx pins. Both of
 * these pins must connect to TMP107's IO1 pin in order to operate. Since there
 * is a possibility for both Master Tx and TMP107 IO1 to actively drive the line
 * at the same, some kind of arbitration must be performed.
 *
 * The TMP107 datasheet suggests using a Tri-State driver (SN74LVC1G125) to
 * emulate an open-drain buffer like SN74LVC1G07. Either solution converts the
 * Master's Tx line to turn off (Hi-Z) when the Master is attempting to drive
 * a logic high (1.) This relies on a pull-up resistor to create the logic
 * high in the same way as used in I2C/SMBus. This is a safe and straight
 * forward way to solve the arbitration issue, but it requires an extra IC.
 *
 * A second way to solve the arbitration issue is to place a 10kohm resistor
 * in series with the Master's Tx line. In the case of a collision where both
 * Master and TMP107 attempt to drive the line, this resistor will limit the
 * Master's drive strength, and prevent any damage. Since UART idles at a logic
 * high, when the Master is inactive, this series resistor acts as a pull-up.
 * The pull-up is not required for TMP107 operation, but it is not harmful either.
 *
 * Both of the above configurations operate without any special software
 * considerations. In fact, they will work with PC controlled COM port. The
 * hardware configuration described below will only work when special care is taken
 * within software to prevent collisions and arbitration issues.
 *
 * Finally, the holy grail is to directly short the Master's Tx and Rx pins
 * together, and then connect them to TMP107 IO1. This hardware configuration
 * requires no external components, but does require software modifications. If
 * your hardware is connected in this way, uncomment the line below for TMP107
 * OneWireUART.
